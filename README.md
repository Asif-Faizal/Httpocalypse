# Httpocalypse

An educational HTTP/1.1 parser and server built from scratch in Go, focusing on core protocol mechanics by handling TCP connections, parsing requests, and crafting responses without high-level libraries. A hands-on way to learn web transport fundamentals while creating a functional server

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of the Go programming language. If you're fuzzy on that, have we got a course for you.
- What binary is, which is covered in our Learn to Code in Python course.
- Understanding of how to use HTTP, because in this course we want to build it. We have an HTTP Clients course and an HTTP Servers course that can help with that.

## Learning Goals

Understand the big ideas of HTTP, and implement the HTTP/1.1 protocol. (Look, the RFC is long, but the main points are fairly straightforward). You'll understand from a high level what happens when you fetch("google.com").
